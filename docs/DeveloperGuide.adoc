== Introduction
=== Product Description (Hui Ming)

Morpheus is a desktop application that aims to facilitate the administrative work of hotel services as a hotel room management system.
The system will also provide statistics and reports, constructed from the analysis of the details in the user-provided database.
Most of the user interaction occurs via a CLI (Command Line Interface).

== Design
//tag::Architecture[]
[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture (Sanchari)

.Architecture Diagram
image::OverallArchitecture.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.

*Morpheus* closely follows the **Command Pattern ** design of software. +
This is a quick representation of how the Command Pattern works: +
_Client -> Invoker -> CommandQueue -> ExecuteCommand_

In this case, the client is the application which creates and adds a command object to the invoker.
The invoker then executes the command objects.
//end::Architecture[]

Given below is a quick overview of the components in the architecture of the software.

<<Design-Main,*`Main`*>> has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

<<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.

* Presents App data in a GUI.
* Receives commands from the user.

<<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.

* Parses the commands entered by user.
* Adds command objects to command queue.

<<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.

* Executes actions indicated by commands on the data in-memory.

<<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows an overview how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteroom`.

.Component interactions for `deleteroom` command
image::ArchitectureComponentDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]

//tag::UiCompJohnny[]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `RoomListPanel`, `PersonListPanel`, `WelcomePanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

* Receive command result to change view accordingly.

Below is diagram for how UI extract command result for changing view.

.Command work flow for MainWindow
image::commandSwitchUi.png[]

//end::UiCompJohnny[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a room).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteroom")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteroom` Command
image::LogicSequenceDiagram.png[]


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores the Hotel data.
* stores the BookKeeper data
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` ,  `ObservableList<Room>` , `ObservableList<Booking>` , `ObservableList<AvailableService>`, `ObservableList<Bill>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes Hotel's data.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component (Sanchari)

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component is responsible for serializing `Model` and deserializing Json data to facilitate reading and writing into the database. +
The `Storage` component can:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.
* can save Hotel data in json format and read it back.
* can save BookKeeper data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::init[]
=== Hotel Initialization (Sanchari)
The following steps show how to set up a hotel by adding guests, rooms and services:

==== AddGuestCommand
===== Implementation
This command adds a guest into the hotel using their name, guest ID, phone and email.

The following steps show how the add guest feature works:

1. The `addguest` command entered by the user is parsed and the different fields are tokenized.
2. `AddGuestCommand#execute(Model model)` is invoked which checks for validity of the entered parameter values.
3. The command is then executed by creating a new Guest object using the parameter values entered and adding the Guest object into the Hotel.
4.  If successful, a `CommandResult` object is created to show a success message in the feedback box of the ui.

The diagram below shows the class diagram for AddGuestCommand.

.Class Diagram for AddGuestCommand
image::AddGuestClass.png[]

===== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new Guest object in AddGuestCommandParser.
** Pros: Simpler to test and understand.
** Cons: Command object should not know details about model i.e. Person.
* **Alternative 2:** New Guest object is created and added to hotel in model.
** Pros: Command has no knowledge of Model and its attributes.
** Cons: More prone to error.

[[Initialization-AddService]]
==== AddService Command
===== Implementation
The following steps show how the AddService command is implemented:

1.  The command from user is parsed and undergoes checks for the validity of the `SERVICE_ID`, `COST` and `DESCRIPTION`.
2.  If the parameters are valid, `AddServiceCommand#execute(Model model)` is invoked, which checks if the service id exists.
3.  If the service id does not exist, a `AvailableService` object is created and `Model#add(AvailableService service)` is called to add an available service to hotel.
4.  If successful, a `CommandResult` object is created to show a success message in the feedback box of the ui.

The diagram below shows the class diagram for AddServiceCommand

.Class Diagram for AddServiceCommand
image::AddServiceClass.png[]

===== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new Service object in AddServiceCommandParser.
** Pros: Simpler to test and understand.
** Cons: Command object should not know details about model i.e. Service.
* **Alternative 2:** New Service object is created and added to hotel in model.
** Pros: Command has no knowledge of Model and its attributes.
** Cons: More prone to error.


==== AddRoomCommand
===== Implementation
This command adds a room into the hotel using the room number, tier and the cost of the room.

The following steps show how the add room feature works:

1. The `addroom` command entered by the user is parsed and the different fields are tokenized.
2. `AddRoomCommand#execute(model)` is invoked which checks for validity of the arguments.
3. If all arguments are valid, a new Room object is created using the tokenized arguments and it is added into the hotel.
4.  If successful, a `CommandResult` object is created to show a success message in the feedback box of the ui.

The diagram below shows the class diagram for AddRoomCommand

.Class Diagram for AddRoomCommand
image::AddRoomClassDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** New Room object is created and added to hotel in Hotel.
** Pros: Command has no knowledge of Model and its attributes.
** Cons: More prone to error.
* **Alternative 2:** Creates a new Guest object in AddRoomCommandParser.
** Pros: Simpler to test and understand.
** Cons: Command object should not know details about model and its attributes i.e. Room.

The Diagram below shows the sequence diagram for AddRoomCommand. All Initialization commands above are similar in their interactions with the <<Design-Logic>> and <<Design-Model>>.

.Sequence Diagram for AddRoomCommand

The Diagram below shows the general activity sequence of the initialization feature.

.Activity Diagram of Hotel Initialization
image::AddCommandDiagram.png[]
//end:init[]

=== Hotel Services (Daniel)

==== Reserve Command
===== Implementation
This command makes a reservation under the specified guest's name for the specified duration.

The following steps show how the Reserve command is implemented.

1. The command from the user is tokenized and parsed.
2. `ReserveCommand#execute(Model model)` is invoked which checks if guest ID, room ID exists in the database and if there are any clashes with other bookings.
3. A new Booking object is created and added into the hotel database.

//tag::checkin[]
==== Checkin Command

This command checks in guest either with a room number, guest's name, and the end date of the stay.
Or by providing the booking ID.

===== Implementation

The following steps show how the CheckIn command is implemented.

1. The command is parsed by `CheckInCommandParser#parse(String args)` into list of pattern there (room number, guest id, end date of the stay or booking id).
2. If `BOOKING_ID` exists in the pattern, it will ignore the rest of the pattern and checkin using that booking id instead by creating `CheckInByIdCommand`
3. The `CheckInByIdCommand` will invoke `model#findBookingById(String BookigId)` which will create a normal `CheckInCommand`
4. `CheckInCommand` will call `model#checkIn` will be called.
5. The list in the UI will be updated by calling `model#updateFilteredRoomList(Predicate predicate)`
6. The room will be charged by calling `model#chargeRoomCost(RoomId roomId, RoomCost roomCost, Stay stay)`.
7. If all of the above is successfully executed, this will return a `CommandResult` object to show success message.

.Sequence Diagram for CheckInCommand
image::CheckInSequenceDiagram.png

===== Design Considerations

Below describes ideas that were considered when designing the command.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a stay object which differentiate between the current stay and reservation.
** Pros: Could easily get the list of current stay.
** Cons: Requires more planning since we have to maintain 2 list now (stay and reservation).
* **Alternative 2:** Store all stay in a reservation object.
** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Cons: Could not differentiate between stay and reservation unless there is another instance in the reservation object.
//end::checkin[]

//tag::checkout[]
==== Checkout Command

This command checks out a guest from the hotel by providing a room number.

===== Implementation

The folowing steps show how the CheckOut command is implemented.

1. The command is parsed by `CheckOutCommandParser#parse(String args)` into list of pattern there (room number).
2. The `CheckOutCommandParser` will create `CheckOutCommand`
3. `CheckOutCommand` will call `model#checkOut` will be called.
4. The list in the UI will be updated by calling `model#updateFilteredRoomList(Predicate predicate)`
5. The room will clean up the previous bill by calling `model#deleteBill(RoomId roomId)`.
6. If all of the above is successfully executed, this will return a `CommandResult` object to show success message.
//end::checkout[]

//tag::extend[]

==== Extend Command

This command extend the booking of a guest by providing room number and end date of the stay.

==== Implementation

1. The command is parsed by `ExtendCommandParser#parse(String args)` into list of pattern there (room number and end date).
2. The `ExtendCommandParser` will create `ExtendCommand`
3. `ExtendCommand` will call `model#extendRoom` to extend the room in the hotel.
4. `ExtendCommand` will call `model#chargeExtendRoomCost` to charge the room according to the room cost and number of extra nights.
5. If this is successfully executer, this will return a `CommandResult` object to show success message.

//end::extend[]


=== Search feature

//tag::findguest[]
==== FindGuestCommand
===== Implementation
Currently this command only support searching for full name or/and id number.

The following steps show how the search guest feature works:

1.  The search command from the user is parsed into a list of pattern contained in the search command.

2.  The command then executes and filters the guest list based on the patterns.

The diagram below show how the search command store its pattern.

.Class diagram for FindGuestCommand
image::FindGuestCommand.png[]

The diagram below shows the execution of the command:

.Activity Diagram of Search Feature
image::SearchWorkflow.png[]

===== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store pattern as list of name and id.
** Pros: Simpler to test and understand.
** Cons: Difficult to extend the implementation.
* **Alternative 2:** Store pattern as a combination of Predicate.
** Pros: Easy to implement and add more complicated pattern.
** Cons: Harder to test, more prone to error.
//end::findguest[]

//tag::billingsystem[]
=== Billing System (Hui Ming)

The billing system is designed to aid hotel receptionists in their bookkeeping. It is oversen by the `BookKeeper` class, which keeps track of all bills in the hotel and facillitates in the manipulation of bills.
The bills are kept in a `UniqueBillList`, which ensures that there are no duplicate bills in the `BookKeeper` class.

The structure of the billing system is shown in the class diagram below:

.Class Diagram of Billing System
image::BillingClassDiagram.png[]

To utilize the billing system, users are provided with the following operations:

* `SetRoomCostCommand` -- Sets the cost of a room.
* `AddServiceCommand` -- Creates a chargeable service.
* `ChargeServiceCommand` -- Charges a guest for a requested service.
* `DeleteChargedServiceCommand` -- Removes a charged service from the bill of a guest.
* `FetchBillCommand` -- Fetches the bill of a guest, including the cost of the room.

The following activity diagram summarizes the typical procedure of billing a guest:

.Activity Diagram of Billing System
image::BillingActivityDiagram.png[]

==== SetRoomCost Command (Hui Ming)

This section goes through the implementation and design considerations of the `SetRoomCost` command.

===== Implementation

The following steps show how the command is implemented:

1.  The command from the user is parsed and undergoes checks for the validity of the given `ROOMNUMBER` and `COST`.
2.  If the parameters are valid, `SetRoomCostCommand#execute(Model model)` is invoked, which checks if the given room exists.
3.  If the room exists, a `RoomCost` object is created and `Model#setRoomCost(Room room, RoomCost roomCost)` is called.
4.  `Room##setCost(RoomCost roomcost)` is then invoked to set the cost of the room by setting the 'roomCost' attribute of the `Room` object.
5.  If successful, a `CommandResult` object is created to show a success message in the feedback box of the ui.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `SetRoomCost` command works with the input `setrcost rn/001 c/50`:

.Sequence Diagram of `SetRooomCost` Command
image::SetRoomCostSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

Below describes ideas that were considered when designing the command.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the cost of the room as an attribute in the `Room` object.
** Pros: Application of OOP concepts.
** Cons: Requires a deeper understanding of the Logic & Model components in order to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the costs of rooms in a separate list (e.g. as a HashMap) in the Hotel component.
** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Cons: Might limit the relationship between the rooms and their costs.

==== AddService Command

The command is also a Hotel Initialization feature and is hence covered above in <<Initialization-AddService>>.

==== ChargeService Command (Hui Ming)

This section goes through the implementation and design considerations of the `ChargeService` command.

===== Implementation

The following steps show how the command is implemented:

1.  The command from the user is parsed and undergoes checks for the validity of the given `PERSONID`, `ROOMNUMBER` and `SERVICEID`.
2.  If the parameters are valid, `ChargeServiceCommand#execute(Model model)` is invoked, which checks if the given guest, room and service exist.
3.  If they exist, `Model#chargeService(RoomId roomId, AvailableService service)` is called which in following calls `BookKeeper#chargeServiceToBill(RoomId roomId, AvailableService service)`.
4.  The bill for the corresponding room is retrieved and `Bill#addService(AvailableService service)` is then invoked by `BookKeeper`.
5.  The service is added to stored list of chargeable objects in the bill and its cost is added to the stored total in the bill.
6.  If successful, a `CommandResult` object is created to show a success message in the feedback box of the ui.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `ChargeService` command works with the input `chargeservice i/A000000 rn/001 si/WC`:

.Sequence Diagram of `ChargeService` Command
image::ChargeServiceSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

Below describes ideas that were considered when designing the command.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the charged services in an ArrayList and the total cost as a double in the bill.
** Pros: Implementing the removal of charges services would be more direct and simple.
** Cons: Have to be careful with the calculation of the total cost.
* **Alternative 2:** Create another class to handle the list of charged services.
** Pros: Calculation of the total cost would be less prone to errors.
** Cons: Might cause the design of the application be unnecessarily complicated with many classes.
//end::billingsystem[]

==== DeleteChargedService Command (Hui Ming)

This section goes through the implementation and design considerations of the `DeleteChargedService` command.

===== Implementation

The following steps show how the command is implemented:

1.  The command from the user is parsed and undergoes checks for the validity of the given `PERSONID`, `ROOMNUMBER` and `SERVICEID`.
2.  If the parameters are valid, `DeleteChargedServiceCommand#execute(Model model)` is invoked, which checks if the given guest, room, service and bill exist.
3.  If they exist, `Model#deleteChargedService(RoomId roomId, AvailableService service)` is called which in following calls `BookKeeper#deleteChargedServiceFromBill(RoomId roomId, AvailableService service)`.
4.  The bill for the corresponding room is retrieved and `Bill#deleteService(AvailableService service)` is then invoked by `BookKeeper`.
5.  The service is removed from the stored list of chargeable objects in the bill and its cost is subtracted from the stored total in the bill.
6.  If successful, a `CommandResult` object is created to show a success message in the feedback box of the ui.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `DeleteChargedService` command works with the input `deletecservice i/A000000 rn/001 si/WC`:

.Sequence Diagram of `DeleteChargedService` Command
image::DeleteChargedServiceSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

Below describes ideas that were considered when designing the command.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Remove any one instance of the service in the list of charged services.
** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Cons: Does not make sense logically.
* **Alternative 2:** Remove the last instance of the service that was inserted.
** Pros: Makes sense logically.
** Cons: Need to keep track of the index, which unnecessarily complicates the program as the output would be the same.

==== FetchBill Command (Hui Ming)

This section goes through the implementation and design considerations of the `FetchBill` command.

===== Implementation

The following steps show how the command is implemented:

1.  The command from the user is parsed and undergoes checks for the validity of the given `PERSONID` and `ROOMNUMBER`, if provided.
2.  If the parameter/s are valid, `FetchBillCommand#execute(Model model)` is invoked, which checks if the given guest, room if `ROOMNUMBER` is provided, and bill/s exist.
3.  If they exist, different methods are called depending on whether `ROOMNUMBER` is provided:

* If `ROOMNUMBER` is provided:

a.  `Model#findBill(RoomId roomId)` is called to retrieve the bill for specified room.
b.  `Bill#getBillTotal()` is next called to get the total cost of expenses.
c.  `Model#updateFilteredBillList(Predicate predicate)` is then called to update the bill tab to show the bill details of the room.
d.  If successful, a `CommandResult` object is created to show a success message in the feedback box of the ui.

* If `ROOMNUMBER` is not provided:

a.  `Model#getGuestBillsTotal(PersonId personId)` is called to get the total of all the bills of the guest.
b.  `Model#updateFilteredBillList(Predicate predicate)` is then called to update the bill tab to show all the bills belonging to the guest.
c.  If successful, a `CommandResult` object is created to show a success message in the feedback box of the ui.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `FetchBill` command works with the input `fetchbill i/A000000 rn/001`:

.Sequence Diagram of FetchBill Command
image::FetchBillSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

Below describes ideas that were considered when designing the command.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow the user to fetch the bill of a room of all bills of a person with a single command.
** Pros: Easier on user as they have lesser commands to remember.
** Cons: More considerations for different scenarios are needed, causing the implementation to be more complicated.
* **Alternative 2:** Have two separate commands to fetch the bill of a room and the bills of a person.
** Pros: Easier to parse the parameters for the command.
** Cons: User needs to remember more commands.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Effort +
(Sanchari)
=== Overview
Morpheus is an extension from AB3 and is considerably more complex than AB3. We have incorporated several new features which required extending the
UI, Storage and Model components of Morpheus. We extended current AB3 features (which only had 1 entity type: AddressBook) to include more entity types such as Hotel and BookKeeper which in turn
contained more entities such as Rooms and Bills. We did this so as to be able to create an application that allows seamless management of a hotel's daily
activities. As there were many new things to add on to AB3, the entire team put in their collaborative effort to create the end product.

=== Challenges

* Planning out the structure and architecture of the application

** A hotel is a complex system of activities, thus we had to hold several meetings to discuss what would be the structure of our application so as to allow
management of all the activities in one app.

* New storage components for the `Hotel` and `BookKeeper`

** As the AddressBook only stored persons, we has to extend the storage system to keep track of the hotel's data and the finance data in the `Hotel` and `BookKeeper`
classes respectively. This required thorough understanding of AB3's storage system.

* New Commands to aid the job of a hotel receptionist.

** We had to extend AB3's current implementation of `Logic` as a hotel receptionist has to manage many more things than a person list. Hence, through
thorough understanding of the `Model` and `Logic` component, we implemented a variety of new commands that works with the model to digitize the management of a hotel.

* User Interface

** We wanted to show all of the hotel's activity and data in 1 window. As such, it was necessary to upgrade AB3's UI to incorporate the hotel's data.
The Ui was improved and edited using JavaFx and CSS. All bugs and errors that were reflected in the Ui were tested and fixed by the team.

=== Conclusion
We believe that this was a difficult project to execute as a hotel has many interlinked components working together. However, through the combined effort
of the entire team, we believe that we have created an end-product that is able to manage the hotel's important activities altogether in one application.
