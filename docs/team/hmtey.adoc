== PROJECT: Morpheus

---

== Overview

Morpheus is a desktop application that aims to facilitate the administrative work of hotel services as a hotel management system. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Set up the *billing system* for the Morpheus

. Added the ability to *charge services to a bill*, *remove charged services from a bill* and *fetch & view bills*
** What it does: Allows the user to keep track of guests' bills and outstanding payments, with a list of their requested or used services.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because as a hotel management system, Morpheus should be able to carry out administrative work like bookkeeping. This makes the billing system a key feature of the product.
** Highlights: This enhancement is a *core feature* of Morpheus and *necessary feature* of the billing system. Hence, it affects commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives as there were many ways to keep track of and manipulate bills in the code.

. Added the ability to *store & load bills*
** What it does: Allows the application to store bill information to the hard disk upon exit and load the data when reopened.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because in order to facilitate bookkeeping, Morpheus must be able to save and load bill information.
** Highlights: This enhancement is a *necessary feature* of the billing system and therefore affects commands to be added in the future. It required a deep understanding of the storage component in the original addressbook.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to set the cost of a room.
